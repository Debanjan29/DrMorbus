# DrMorbus
What it Does
Project DrMorbus for this hackathon uses a Machine Learning model for disease prediction. The user would have to give five(5) symptoms to us against which our ML model would predict the Disease and would give a result.
Also, the user can learn about the Precaution and Symptoms’ against various disease from the website .
How we built it
•	Backend :
o	DrMorbus utilizes Flask as the backend

•	Frontend
o	The React.js application, which is hosted on Firebase,is used to create the basic Framework/UI . We made the Sidebar, the Information div, and the ‘Take Your Test Now’ part using the same. We used basic CSS to design our website’.We also used MATERIAL UI to make the dropdown.

Challenges we ran Into:

Because it was our very first time using REACT ROUTER, we weren't familiar with the various libraries and thr routing process. We weren't even able to download the client libraries, generate credentials file, make HTTP requests to the API, receive data, and so forth.

Also, it was our first time using Flask, and so we struggled with the basic syntax and it was difficult for us to integrate the API.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

Despite the challenges we ran into, we're able to figure all of them out before the submission deadline.
We're very proud that we made from zero knowledge to making an MVP prototype.

What we learned:
We learned that once we understand how one programming language works, it's easy to pick up a new language quickly.
All we need is documentation and some example codes.

What's next for DrMorbus:
Of course, refactoring has to be done on both the backend and the frontend applications. Given that this project was created during a hackathon, we did not consider scalability and orthogonality of pragmatic programming.
On the technical side, we need to improve the accuracy of ML model and the frontend design .
