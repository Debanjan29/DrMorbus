# DrMorbus

Project DrMorbus uses a Machine Learning model for disease prediction. The user selects five(5) symptoms, against which our ML model predicts the Disease and would give a result.
Also, the user can learn about the Precaution and Symptomsâ€™ against various disease from the website.



## Technologies Used:
- In this project the Flask framework is used for making the Backend of the webapp.
- The Machine Learning model is integrated in the Backend
- In the frontend ReactJs is used with other libraries including react-router-dom
- MATERIAL UI is also used in the project

## Challenges we ran Into:
- As it was our very first time using REACT ROUTER, we weren't familiar with the various libraries and the routing process.
- fetching API data to frontend from backend was one of the greatest problem faced

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:

Despite the challenges we ran into, we're able to figure all of them out before the submission deadline.
We're very proud that we made from zero knowledge to making an MVP prototype.

## What's next for DrMorbus:
Refactoring has to be done on both the backend and the frontend applications. Given that this project was created during a hackathon, we did not consider scalability and orthogonality of pragmatic programming.
On the technical side, we need to improve the accuracy of ML model and the frontend design.
